"""Custom agents created by users using the LLM Agent Designer

This module contains custom agents that have been created by users
through the LLM Agent Designer interface. These agents extend
the base agent functionality to provide specialized capabilities.

Custom agents are automatically discovered and can be registered
with the agent registry for use in conversations.
