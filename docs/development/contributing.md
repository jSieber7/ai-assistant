uv run mypy app/
```

### 4. Submitting Changes
```bash
# Commit with descriptive message
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new tool integration"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a pull request on GitHub
```

## üèóÔ∏è Code Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and returns
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Code Quality Tools
The project uses several automated tools:

```bash
# Format code (automatically fixes style issues)
uv run black .

# Check code style
uv run ruff check .

# Type checking
uv run mypy app/

# Security scanning
uv run bandit -r app/
uv run pip-audit
```

### Testing Requirements
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Include both unit tests and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## üìù Documentation Standards

### API Documentation
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Document error conditions and status codes

### Tool Documentation
- Document new tools with usage examples
- Include configuration instructions
- Provide troubleshooting guides

### Architecture Documentation
- Update architecture diagrams for significant changes
- Document design decisions and trade-offs

## üîß Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/feature-name`: New features
- `fix/bug-description`: Bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-topic`: Documentation improvements
- `refactor/component-name`: Code refactoring

### Commit Message Format
```
type: description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:
```
feat: add web search tool integration

- Implement SearX integration
- Add tool selection logic
- Include error handling

Closes #123
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests
```python
def test_new_feature():
    """Test descriptive name for the test."""
    # Arrange - set up test conditions
    test_input = "test data"
    
    # Act - perform the action being tested
    result = function_under_test(test_input)
    
    # Assert - verify the outcome
    assert result == expected_output

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_feature():
    """Test async functionality."""
    result = await async_function()
    assert result is not None
```

### Test Structure
- **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Performance tests**: Test response times and resource usage
- **Error handling tests**: Test failure scenarios

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run with coverage
python run_tests.py --coverage

# Run specific test types
python run_tests.py --unit
python run_tests.py --integration

# Run tests in parallel
python run_tests.py --parallel
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Secure Development Practices
- Never hardcode API keys or secrets
- Validate all user input
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Security Testing
- Run security scans before submitting PRs
- Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Verify authentication and authorization logic

## üöÄ Feature Development

### Adding New Tools
1. **Design the tool interface**
2. **Implement the tool functionality**
3. **Write comprehensive tests**
4. **Document the tool usage**
5. **Integrate with the agent system**

### Adding API Endpoints
1. **Design the endpoint specification**
2. **Implement the route handler**
3. **Add request/response models**
