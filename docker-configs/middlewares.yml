    # NOTE: You will also need to move any other file-based middlewares
    # here, like `security-headers`, `rate-limit`, and `compression`
    # that are used by your `ai-assistant` service.
    # For example:
    # security-headers:
    #   headers:
    #     customFrameOptionsValue: "SAMEORIGIN"
    #     # ... other security headers
