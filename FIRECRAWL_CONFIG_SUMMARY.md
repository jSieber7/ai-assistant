## Firecrawl Configuration Summary

### What We've Done:
1. **Updated docker-compose.yml** with new firecrawl configuration
   - Added firecrawl-api service with NuQ database dependency
   - Added playwright-service for browser automation
   - Added nuq-postgres for the NuQ database
   - Configured searxng integration with firecrawl

2. **Configured Service Dependencies**
   - Set up proper networking between services
   - Configured environment variables for database connections
   - Set up searxng as the search engine for firecrawl

3. **Tested the Configuration**
   - Verified that searxng is running and responding on port 8088
   - Confirmed that redis is healthy and running
   - Attempted to start firecrawl services

### Current Status:
- Redis and searxng are running successfully
- Firecrawl service is having issues with database connections (trying to connect to localhost:5432 instead of the proper Docker service)
- The NuQ database tables are not initialized, which is causing the firecrawl workers to fail

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the database connection issue in firecrawl
2. Initialize the NuQ database schema
3. Test the full integration between firecrawl and searxng
