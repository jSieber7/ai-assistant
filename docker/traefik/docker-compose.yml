# This file is kept for reference but the traefik service is now defined in the main docker-compose.yml
# to avoid duplication. The main docker-compose.yml contains the complete traefik configuration
# with environment variables, proper labels, and shared-network integration.

# If you need to add additional traefik-related services, add them to the main docker-compose.yml
# or create a separate include file for specific extensions.
