# An AI assistant built with a tool-calling ensemble of LLMs

This repository hosts an ai assistant powered by series of LLM Agents. It is designed to provide a human-like assistant with LLM tool calling that can be used through an OpenAI API type interface. This interface will allow this API to be used with many different LLM front ends. Built with LangChain and FastAPI.

## Key Features
* **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Full compatibility with OpenAI API specification
* **OpenRouter Integration**: Support for multiple LLM providers via OpenRouter
* **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming responses for chat completions
* **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new tools and capabilities
* **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with unit and integration tests

## Key Features to be Implemented / Roadmap
* **Extendable Codebase**: Allows the implementation of more tool-calling capabilities.
  * The most important tool will be web search through a SearX instance. In this manner, any chosen AI will have access to the latest information at any given time. 
* **Customizability**: Freedom in LLM model selection. This will allow users to use cloud based models as well as local models.
* **Rapid Experimentation**: One example, small LLM writers alongside larger LLM proof readers to generate messages for the user. Techniques such as these have often been limited to private, hidden code. 
* **Docker Ready**: Eventually the project will be Dockerized to allow a consistent and efficient way to install and host the API on remote computing platforms.
