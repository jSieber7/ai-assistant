# Prompt Engineering Guide

This guide covers prompt engineering techniques for getting the best results from AI models in the AI Assistant System.

## Overview

Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing effective prompts to elicit desired responses from AI models. Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the quality, relevance, and accuracy of model outputs.

## Basic Principles

### 1. Be Clear and Specific

Vague prompts lead to vague responses. Be specific about what you want.

**Poor Example:**
```
Tell me about cars
```

**Good Example:**
```
Explain the key differences between electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, focusing on environmental impact, performance, and cost of ownership.
```

### 2. Provide Context

Give the model relevant background information to help it understand the request.

**Example:**
```
You are an expert financial advisor with 15 years of experience helping clients make investment decisions. Based on this expertise, analyze the following investment portfolio...
```

### 3. Set the Format

Specify the desired output format to get structured responses.

**Example:**
```
Analyze the following text and provide your response in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "sentiment": "positive/negative/neutral",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "key_points": ["point1", "point2", "point3"]
}
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought Prompting

Guide the model through step-by-step reasoning.

**Example:**
```
Solve this math problem step by step:
Problem: A store sells apples for $2 each and oranges for $3 each. If a customer buys 5 apples and 3 oranges, how much do they spend in total?

Step 1: Calculate the cost of apples
Step 2: Calculate the cost of oranges
Step 3: Add the costs together
Final Answer:
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to help the model understand the pattern.

**Example:**
```
Convert the following sentences to passive voice:

Example 1:
Active: The chef prepared the meal.
Passive: The meal was prepared by the chef.

Example 2:
Active: The team won the championship.
Passive: The championship was won by the team.

Now convert:
Active: The student wrote the essay.
Passive:
```

### 3. Role-Based Prompting

Assign a specific role to the model.

**Example:**
```
You are a senior software engineer at a tech company. Review this code for potential security vulnerabilities:

```python
def login(username, password):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
    return execute_query(query)
```

Identify security issues and suggest improvements.
```

### 4. Constraint-Based Prompting

Set specific constraints on the response.

**Example:**
```
Write a product description for a smart home device with these constraints:
- Maximum 100 words
- Include at least 3 key features
- Target audience: tech-savvy homeowners
- Tone: professional but approachable
```

## Prompt Templates
