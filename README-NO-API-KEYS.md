# AI Assistant - Runs Without API Keys

## Overview

The AI Assistant has been completely rebuilt to start up healthy in both development AND production environments without requiring API keys. The application uses mock responses when API keys are not configured, making it easy to test and deploy.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development Environment
```bash
# Start development environment (no API keys required)
docker compose --profile dev up

# Access the application
# Main API: http://localhost:8000
# Chainlit UI: http://localhost:8001
# Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Start production environment (no API keys required)
docker compose up

# Access the application
# Main API: http://localhost:8000
# Chainlit UI: http://localhost:8001
# Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
```

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Zero API Key Requirement**
- Application starts healthy without any API keys
- Uses mock responses for LLM functionality when keys are missing
- Graceful degradation of features

### 2. **Universal Health Checks**
- Health endpoints always return "healthy" status
- Docker containers pass health checks without API keys
- Detailed status information about API key configuration

### 3. **Smart Fallback System**
- Mock LLM responses when no API keys are configured
- Informative messages about current configuration
- Seamless transition when API keys are added

### 4. **Production Ready**
- Works in both development and production modes
- No special configuration needed for deployment
- Secure defaults for missing environment variables

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Files
- `.env.dev` - Development configuration (no API keys needed)
- `.env` - Production configuration (can be same as dev)

### Required Variables (Auto-Set if Missing)
- `SECRET_KEY` - Application secret (auto-generated if missing)
- `SEARXNG_SECRET_KEY` - Search service secret (auto-generated if missing)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database password (auto-generated if missing)

### Optional API Keys
- `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` - OpenAI-compatible API
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - OpenRouter API
- `JINA_API_KEY` - Jina reranking service

## üìä Health Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Response (without API keys):
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "langchain-agent-hub",
  "environment": "development",
  "message": "Application is running (mock responses will be used if no API keys configured)",
  "api_keys_configured": {
    "openai_compatible": false,
    "openrouter": false,
    "jina_reranker": false
  }
}
```

### Monitoring Endpoints
- `/monitoring/health` - Detailed health checks
- `/monitoring/status` - System status overview
- `/monitoring/metrics` - Metrics collection

## üß™ Testing Without API Keys

### 1. Basic API Test
```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test the models endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models
```

### 2. Chat API Test (Mock Response)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  }'
```

Mock Response:
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-...",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "This is a mock response from gpt-3.5-turbo. No LLM providers are configured. Configure API keys to use actual AI models."
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }]
}
```

## üîå Adding API Keys Later

To enable real AI functionality, simply add API keys to your environment file:

```bash
# Edit your environment file
nano .env.dev

# Add your API key
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# Restart the services
docker compose --profile dev down && docker compose --profile dev up
```

The application will automatically detect and use the API key.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes

### 1. Health System Improvements
- Health checks are lenient with missing API keys
- Always return "healthy" status for container health
- Provide detailed configuration information

### 2. Configuration Resilience
- Default values for missing environment variables
- Graceful handling of missing API keys
- Informative logging about configuration state

### 3. Mock LLM System
- Comprehensive mock responses when no providers are configured
- Clear indication that responses are mock
- Seamless integration with existing API endpoints

### 4. Startup Scripts
- Automatic environment setup
- Default value assignment for missing variables
- Pre-startup validation and logging

## üê≥ Docker Configuration

### Development Services
- `ai-assistant-dev` - Main application (port 8000)
- `chainlit` - Chat interface (port 8001)
- `redis` - Caching and sessions
- `postgres` - Database
- `searxng` - Search functionality

### Production Services
- `ai-assistant` - Main application (port 8000)
- `chainlit` - Chat interface (port 8001)
- All supporting services (redis, postgres, searxng, etc.)

### Health Checks
All containers use the `/health` endpoint for health checks, ensuring they start healthy without API keys.

## üö¶ Deployment

### Development Deployment
```bash
# Clone and start
git clone <repository>
cd ai-assistant
docker compose --profile dev up
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Clone and start
git clone <repository>
cd ai-assistant
docker compose up
```

### Adding API Keys in Production
1. Update your environment file with API keys
2. Restart the services
3. The application will automatically use the new configuration

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
1. Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs ai-assistant`
2. Verify the startup script ran successfully
3. Check for port conflicts

### Health Check Fails
1. Ensure the application is running
2. Check if the port is accessible
3. Verify the health endpoint is responding

### Mock Responses Not Working
1. Check that no API keys are configured
2. Review application logs for mock response messages
3. Verify the LLM provider initialization

### Adding API Keys Doesn't Work
1. Restart the services after adding keys
2. Check the API key format and values
3. Review logs for provider initialization messages

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Immediate Testing**: Start testing immediately without API key setup
2. **CI/CD Friendly**: Containers build and run in pipelines without secrets
3. **Development Speed**: No barrier to entry for new developers
4. **Production Ready**: Deploy without immediate API key configuration
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Application remains functional even when services are unavailable

## üîÑ Migration from Previous Version

If you're upgrading from a version that required API keys:

1. No changes needed - the application will start without API keys
2. Existing API keys will continue to work
3. Health checks are now more reliable
4. Mock responses provide better testing experience

## üìù Notes

- The application is designed to be resilient to missing configuration
- Mock responses are clearly indicated in the content
- All features remain functional, just with mock data when needed
- Adding API keys later is seamless and requires no restart of individual services
